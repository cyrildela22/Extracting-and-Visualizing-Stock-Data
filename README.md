# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data
## Introduction
This is an IBM Coursera Project Assignment which primarily focuses on extracting , visualizing and analyzing stock data.
Since extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science, the python package yfinance and the ticker function was used to extract the stock data. 

Secondly, webscraping is used to extract Tesla revenue data using python package beautifulsoup and requests.get().text function. 
Data wrangling being an important step in data analysis, the dataset had to be cleaned.
I wrote a code to remove all null or empty strings, comma's and dollar sign in the Revenue column.
Matplotlib was the used to visualize the data and analyze the data
